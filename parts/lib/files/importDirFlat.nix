{ lib, ... }:
/*
  Flattens a directory tree of nix modules into a single-level
  attrset whose keys are the path segments joined by a separator
  (default: "-").

  Example:
    dir
    ├─ hardware/
    │  └─ gpu/
    │     └─ nvidia.nix
    └─ networking/
       ├─ default.nix
       └─ firewall/
          └─ default.nix

  becomes
    {
      hardware-gpu-nvidia = import ./dir/hardware/gpu/nvidia.nix;
      networking = import ./dir/networking;              # default.nix
      networking-firewall = import ./dir/networking/firewall; # default.nix
    }

  Notes:
  - If a directory has a default.nix, it is included as a key at its level,
    and we still recurse into its subdirectories.
  - `default.nix` files are not added as leaf entries directly to avoid duplicates;
    the directory’s own key represents them.
